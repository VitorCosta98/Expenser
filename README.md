## Description
The idea of this app is to manage your money & finances, allow you to see your spending by category, set up bill payments, keep track of your incomes, and plan for savings.

The required features of the app are:

* Display and compare total cost by day, month, year.
* Show your invoices during the day.
* Add a new invoice.
* Show categories (including food, water bills, etc).
* Show categories with used invoices (for collecting purpose).
* This expense management app works in the following way:

First, in the '<span style="color:red"> Home </span>' screen, you will see comparative charts which will help keep track and make comparisons of the current day’s expenses. Below the charts, a list will display all invoices you have paid that day.

Next, as you click the '<span style="color:red"> Add New </span>' button, catalogs will appear. Clicking on each specific catalog will lead to the next screen where you can input the amount of money and give a description for that invoice.

When things are done, the app will automatically return to its home screen. By utilizing the <span style="color:red"> Tabbar </span> navigation, you can create 3 items: <span style="color:red"> Home </span>, <span style="color:red"> Activities </span>, and <span style="color:red"> Setting </span> Activities screen displays recorded bills in categories (for example, Food: 3 bills, Drink: 4 bills, etc). Clicking on a specific item to see the details.

'<span style="color:red"> Setting </span>' enables users to edit their information and images.

### So what can I apply, next?
1. Chart View, Table View, Collection View: to create impressive screens.
2. Tabbar Navigation and View Controller Navigation.

Project to practice View Code and MVVM architecture.
